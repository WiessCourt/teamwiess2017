            <h3>Wiess Tradition</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
            Despite the formality of Sunday supper, Wiessmen found time to create some of their own unorthodox customs that became known as distinctly Wiess. These included the third-floor dangle and the Ubangee. Although the Ubangee is still proudly practiced, the dangle disappeared as human life became more valuable. Wiess also developed an arch nemesis during those formulative years: Hanszen. Probably because of their proximity, there arose a rivalry between Wiess and its accursed neighbor. Unfortunately, Hanszen’s lameness tends to dampen the rivalry and we often turn our attention to any other college bold enough to try to mess with us. When it’s worth it, Wiess always prevails.

            The blazer, the Sunday formal dinners and many other more formal institutions of the college started to disappear as the ’70s rolled in. The Wiess we know today then started to take a shape. College rules were relaxed, and women gained unlimited visiting hours. Huge parties, which were the best on campus, became common. Then came the now-famous “Team Wiess” cheer derived from a blend of a ’70s Xerox commercial with the phrase, “Team Xerox,” the movie The Longest Yard (in which football fans chanted the phrase, “Mean Machine”) and the TeamBank chain of banks. The glorious “Team Wiess” cheer made its debut at Beer Bike 1975 when the team celebrated its second win ever with a chant of “Wiess Team, Wiess Team!” Since then, the deep, resonating chant has become Wiess’ metaphorical heartbeat and our trademark on campus.

            During the ’80s, Wiessmen were still party animals and cheered loudly at the dinner announcement that Wiess had the lowest grade point average on campus. On a more local but no less impressive scale was the most notorious jack ever to go down in Rice history. In 1988, a team of Wiessmen angered by the upcoming hike in tuition turned the statue of William Marsh Rice in the quad to face Fondren Library, thus turning his back on the administration. The jack is still legendary. Another highlight of the ’80s was the addition of females to Wiess college, the second-to-last all-male college. Wiess women were originally brave volunteers who opted to move there. While there were a small fraction of men who continued to chant, “all male college” the vast majority of Wiessmen welcomed women to the Wiess family, and their addition only strengthened the Wiess spirit and sense of community (and allowed us to dominate on the powderpuff field). This is also the time when the term Wiessmen became unisex.
