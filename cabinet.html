            <h2>Wiess Cabinet</h2>
            <p>
                The Wiessmen of Cabinet are a trusted group of individuals.  Elected by their fellow Wiessmen they are tasked with the strenuous duty of maintaining Wiess and ensuring its status as the best college on campus.  Each member of Cabinet has a specialized job and maintains a part of the glory that is Wiess College.  Together, they spend the generous budget and host spectacular events that are the envy of every other college.

          <h2>Tay Jacobe</h2> <i>Email: taj3@rice.edu</i><br>
          <i>The president calls meetings of Cabinet and presides over Cabinet meetings.  This position has the power to appoint and dismiss the coordinators and chairmen of all committees and is expected to represent Wiess College at College, SA, and University events.</i><br><br>
          <p style="max-width:90%">I am so excited to serve as Wiess' President, and I hope to be able to make impactful, positive change! I have three main priorities for my presidency: (1) Inclusivity, especially of groups that may feel not included by Wiess' current culture or activities, (2) Accountability, accessibility, and availability of student government members, and (3) Thoughtful consideration of our traditions, legislation, and culture and how it could be improved.</p>

          <i>The IVP assumes duties of the president upon the absence, resignation, or impeachment. This position also coordinates Summit, Big Bang, Pumpkin Caroling as well as manages the Wiess representative positions.</i><br><br>
          <p style="max-width:90%">As IVP, my focus will be to make Wiess the best home it can be. I plan to focus on Wiess events, culture, and traditions to cultivate a fun, energetic, inclusive and safe community for all Wiessmen. I intend to work with the A-team and other event-planners at Wiess to encourage involvement and initiative, especially from the new students at the beginning of the school year. I want to ensure that any Wiessman with an idea can make their vision a reality for Wiess, by serving as a Wiess rep, coordinating an event, or even launching a new tradition. Finally, I want to start discussions about how we can make meaningful changes at our college and collaborate with Wiessmen to implement them effectively.</p>

          <p style="max-width:95%">During my term as EVP, I hope to continue my work on improving the associates program by developing associate visibility within the college. I will accomplish this by planning study breaks, hosting academic and career related events, and searching for active and involved potential associates. I also want to ensure that alumni still feel like they are a part of Wiess college by making alumni events such as the Alumni BBQ as well planned and grand as possible. I want to take advantage of alumni resources to plan large Wiess events, such as Wiess goes to a Dynamos game. Lastly, I want to make sure that the Outreach Committee is regularly going on service trips and actively engaged in the community outside of the hedges.</p>

            <p style="font-size:14px">My goals for the year are primarily focused on efficiency and transparency. There are a lot of budgets this year that have been underused, either due to inaccurate allocation or just wrong budget sizes, so what I want to do is reallocate funds to the places they are actually used so that our money is more effective. Additionally, throughout the year, I want to track how the money is used, and model exactly where we are as compared to predictions based on previous years to determine if we should be spending or saving. Finally, I want to make the budget more transparent by possibly sending out emails towards the middle and end of the year with the budget attached, highlighting the specific budgets that are being underutilized so that Wiessmen know exactly what to do with the money.</p>

More importantly, I want to get more Wiessmen involved in projects of their own interest, because student government is a tool for all of us to get the change we want.</p>
