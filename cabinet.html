            <h2>Wiess Cabinet</h2>
            <p>
                The Wiessmen of Cabinet are a trusted group of individuals.  Elected by their fellow Wiessmen they are tasked with the strenuous duty of maintaining Wiess and ensuring its status as the best college on campus.  Each member of Cabinet has a specialized job and maintains a part of the glory that is Wiess College.  Together, they spend the generous budget and host spectacular events that are the envy of every other college.

          <i>The president calls meetings of Cabinet and presides over Cabinet meetings.  This position has the power to appoint and dismiss the coordinators and chairmen of all committees and is expected to represent Wiess College at College, SA, and University events.</i><br><br>
          <p> I am so excited to serve as Wiess' President, and I hope to be able to make impactful, positive change! I have three main priorities for my presidency: (1) Inclusivity, especially of groups that may feel not included by Wiess' current culture or activities, (2) Accountability, accessibility, and availability of student government members, and (3) Thoughtful consideration of our traditions, legislation, and culture and how it could be improved.</p>

          <i>The EVP is the chair of the Associates Committee and coordinates the selection and assimilation of Associates.  This position is also involved in coordinating interactions between current Wiessmen and alumni, other colleges, and the surrounding community.</i><br><br>
          <p> During my term as EVP, I hope to continue my work on improving the associates program by developing associate visibility within the college. I will accomplish this by planning study breaks, hosting academic and career related events, and searching for active and involved potential associates. I also want to ensure that alumni still feel like they are a part of Wiess college by making alumni events such as the Alumni BBQ as well planned and grand as possible. I want to take advantage of alumni resources to plan large Wiess events, such as Wiess goes to a Dynamos game. Lastly, I want to make sure that the Outreach Committee is regularly going on service trips and actively engaged in the community outside of the hedges.</p>
