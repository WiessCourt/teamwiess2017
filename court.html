            <h2>Wiess Court</h2>
            <p>Wiess Court is a safety net. Court makes sure that all Wiessmen are aware of the basic rules that are in place and abide by them so we can keep our privileges, such as a “wet” campus and a quiet, trusting atmosphere. If anything goes wrong, we try to deal with it inside the college. By acting as a liason between Wiessmen and Student Judicial Programs/RUPD, we try to resolve issues quickly and effectively. When things arise that court is not fit to handle, they may be settled by the Adult Team (Masters and RA's), and if an issue is beyond their clearance, it is settled entirely by University Court and Student Judicial Programs.</p>
            <p>Court’s job is to support an environment of mutual respect and responsibility by enforcing both Wiess College rules and Rice University rules. Most of these rules are common sense, and even as a new student, you should have no problem abiding by them. Any academic violations should be reported to the Honor Council. However, if you’ve got non-academic issues, questions, concerns, complaints, problems or irreconcilable intra-college disputes, please do not hesitate to contact any of the Wiess Court members to talk about it. With good common sense and responsibility, we can ensure that Wiess College remains a safe and enjoyable environment for all of its inhabitants.</p>
