                <h4>We here at Wiess are all so excited to meet you, but without further adue, here's some information about the college where you will spend an amazing four years. First, we have a number of useful and unique spaces available to students.  The space below are open to students at any time, however if you want to ensure a room's availability during a certain time, you can reserve a room by contacting your Wiess secretary <a href="mailto:mld2@rice.edu">Meagan Dwyer</a>.</h4>

                            The private dining room is a quiet room attached to the Commons is a nice place to have meetings and is frequented by the A-Team and the Rice Philharmonics.  There’s a lot of Wiess history in here, including pictures of all our former Masters, and a lot of old Campaniles as well.  Look for pictures of Dr. Byrd as a student, or camp out to get down to business.

                            If you want to bake something, make popcorn, or even cook dinner on those Saturday nights when the server is closed, the Third Floor Kitchen is the place to do it.  We just completely redesigned it with new counters, new tile, and new stove! Also, ask the Kitchen Reps (Ian Mellor-Crummey and Molly Cisneros) for access to baking supplies.

                            Also unique to Wiess is our dance theater, complete with speakers, nice wood floors, and full-length mirrors.  The dance theater is perfect for choreographing your latest Youtube hit or your dance for the O-Week Talent Show.  IT is located on the second floor below the RA suites.

                        <p>
                            Wiess is home to the largest commons on campus, which means lots of space but maybe not the best lighting at night.  During the day, enjoy our huge windows while eatin lunch with fellow Wiessmen, or find a quiet table to study on late at night.  It also has a piano which is frequented by our musicians.  Most big events at Wiess such as NOD, Salsa Night, Tabletop performances, and even our Superbowl watching party, are held in the Commons.

                            The movie room: stuff of legend and the desire of every other college on campus.  WE have brand new, extremely comfortable couches, stadium seating, and an even newer projector to replace our old TV.  Old Wiessmen tell of the days of surround sound, but worse couches.  This is a great place to spend a Friday night with some friends and lots of popcorn.  Don’t forget to check out the huge Wiess movie collection, housed by our Movie Reps.  The Wiess Movie Room is located on the fourth floor by the elevator.

                            Sparky’s used to be a Wiess storage closet, but has been slowly transformed in the past five years.  This goldenrod room is a great place to study during the day, jam to some karaoke or play poker at night, or even watch some powderpuff.  The air hockey and ping pong tables have also been relocated to Sparky’s.  Sparky’s is located on the fourth floor right next to the movie room and tucked away in the corner.

                        <h3>Your Suite</h3>
                        <p>For your first year, you will be assigned to what we call a double—a suite with four people in two rooms and a shared common room. The bedrooms and   common rooms are each approximately 16' x 12'.  Each suite also has its own bathroom, which means no trekking down the hall in the middle of the night when you need to use the bathroom. Be advised that the bathrooms have no cabinetry so buying a plastic storage container is advisable, especially for those of you who have lots of toiletry items.</p>

                        <p>In the common room you will find a bookcase (pictured below), tiled flooring, and space to be adventurous. Wiessmen often choose to outfit their common rooms with couches, recliners, mini-fridges, etc., but if you are apprehensive about transporting large furniture, rest assured that there almost always tend to be cheap furniture floating around with “a lot of sentimental value.” If that doesn't work out there are also great (read: economical) furniture places in Houston, and you can always try your luck with Craigslist. Most common rooms can very comfortably fit a large couch or two small couches, your mini-fridge and a TV stand (to give you a better idea about size).</p>
                        <p>If you're planning to share appliances or entertainment devices (e.g. TV, DVD player) with your roommate and suitemates, make sure to communicate with them in advance. You probably don't want to end up with three mini-fridges and no microwave (or do you?).</p>

Most people don't find it necessary to bunk their beds, and there's not much of a need for more furniture in you bedroom, unless you want to have a special desk chair or a simple bookshelf.</p>

                        <p>The Byrds—there are four of them, two larger and two smaller—are anxious to meet you! Dr. Byrd teaches in the department of History and has worked at the university since 1998. He was born in Hawaii, and grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado as well as right here in Houston. A student of eighteenth-century Afro America and of modern African American life in the United States, he is especially interested in the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the course of school desegregation in the south. He’s just as keen, though, to hear about your plans for the world and what you want from your time at Rice and Wiess.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Byrd is an educator and is currently the principal of Cummings Elementary School in West Houston. She hails from western Kentucky, and was educated at Berea College and at the University of London. If you are considering a career working with young people, she’s an excellent source of advice and information. Mrs. Byrd also loves to move! She’s addicted to early morning Boot Camp at the nearby YMCA, and is always down for a jog, a brisk walk, or impromptu aerobics. Like to start your Saturdays with a run? You don’t have to do it alone.</p>
                        <p>The Big Byrds have been married forever, and have picked up two other Byrds along the way: Benjamin and Jenna. Benjamin loves basketball, but perhaps loves classical and jazz guitar even more. Jenna’s tastes gravitate toward gymnastics and sprinting . The smallish Byrds are voracious readers and avid swimmers. Both have been educated in several of the city’s Spanish immersion schools. So code-switch with them (please).</p>
                        <p>The Byrds live adjacent to the college at the Wilson House (named for a long-time Wiess college RA). You’ll see them at meals, Wiess events, and across campus. They’re here to support the college (which is you!). So if you are ever feeling a little lost, don’t hesitate to mosey on over. They’re eager to help you navigate the university. And when you have a particularly proud moment, let them know. They want to celebrate with you. There will be ample opportunity to hang out with them at “the house.” Get ready for Solos and Duets study break, Twenty Minute Jazz Festival, Brunch Book Club, and other reasons to take a break from your daily grind with the family next door. In any case, they can’t wait to see all of the wonderful things you’ll do here over the next few years!</p>

                        <p>Renata, Lenin & Gavin are the resident associates living on the 3rd floor of Wiess and are currently enjoying their 4th year as part of TFW.  They love to spend time around Wiess and getting to know all the Wiessmen. You will often find them around the acabowl (or sitting on the acaglider) helping other Wiessmen procrastinate and relax. Stop by when you see them around or come by their room anytime you need to chat, relax, tell exciting stories or just complain about life - their door is always open if you need a friendly ear.  If you like babies, stop by their room after December.  I’ve heard they might have a new TFW-member arriving around that time.</p>
                        <p>Besides being RAs at the best college, Renata teaches in the Bioengineering department, Lenin works for Schlumberger, and Gavin plays in the acabowl. Gavin (also known as the acababy) has been a wiessman all of his life: he was born at a hospital across the street, but quickly found his way to Wiess and decided to stay and start building his goldenrod wardrobe.  All 3 of them enjoy eating good food, traveling and cheering for your battlesows on the powderpuff field. Lenin likes scuba diving and Renata likes horseback riding; so Lenin dials back his respect for horses to go riding and Renata chooses to forget the reasons why humans are not aquatic to go diving.  Gavin has been on a horse once and he loved it. He absolutely loves frisbee, balls, the trampoline and Chinese yo-yo and he can be spotted playing in the acabowl most afternoons (he’ll drag you to play if you let him).  Join them for dinner, a movie, Monday Night Football, cookies and tea or barbacoa study break.</p>
