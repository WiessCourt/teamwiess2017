                <h4>We here at Wiess are all so excited to meet you, and you will be receiving a humongous book of information about Wiess shortly. If you're feeling impatient, here's some information about the college where you will spend an amazing four years. First, we have a number of useful and unique spaces available to students.  The space below are open to students at any time, however if you want to ensure a room's availability during a certain time, you can reserve a room with your Wiess secretary Kaitlyn Swinney using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/rice.edu/forms/d/1uBG7GAUopbA3lRZD-6x9JQkcKuNBi_oxxdyoZZVk0JQ/viewform">this form.</a></h4>

                        <p>
                            Wiess is home to the largest commons on campus, which means lots of space and shockingly effective sound muffling. During the day, enjoy our huge windows while eating lunch with fellow Wiessmen, or find a quiet table to study on late at night. It also has a piano which is frequented by our resident musicians. Most big events at Wiess, such as NOD, Salsa Night, and even our Superbowl watching party, are held in the Commons.

                            The movie room is seriously the stuff of legend and the desire of every other college on campus. We have brand new, extremely comfortable couches, stadium seating, and a recently installed projector with 4k picture capabilities (people who understand technology claim this is very impressive). This is a great place to spend a Friday night with some friends and lots of popcorn, but be sure to check the Wiess calendar online to see if it's already been reserved! Also check out the huge Wiess movie collection, housed by our Movie Reps. It's located on the fourth floor by the elevator.

                            When you inevitably find yourself running out of clothes and clean socks, fear not. Wiess has its very own laundry room, and the machines are free! Just remember to follow the rules: if someone's wet clothes are in the washing machine you need, move them to the dryer <b>on low or medium heat</b>, and if clothes in a dryer are still wet, run them again! Don't forget to bring High Efficiency detergent: good for your clothes and the environment. The laundry room is located on the first floor right by the Commons.

                            This quiet room attached to the Commons is a nice place to have meetings and is frequented by the A-Team and the Rice Philharmonics. There's a lot of Wiess history in here, including pictures of all our former Masters, and a lot of old Campanile's as well. Look for pictures of Dr. Byrd as a student, or camp out to get down to business.

                            Sparky's used to be a Wiess storage closet, but has been slowly transformed in the past five years in various different directions. This vibrant goldenrod room is a great place to study during the day, play various games with your friends, or even watch some powderpuff. We have lots of tables, mini basketball hoops, big windows, and of course, the Wiess crest. Sparky’s is located on the fourth floor right next to the movie room and tucked away in the corner.

We just recently completely redesigned it, with new counters, new tile and new stoves! Ask the Kitchen Reps for access to any baking supplies you need.

                        <hr>
                        <p>For your first year, you will be assigned to what we call a double—a suite with four people in two rooms and a shared common room. The bedrooms and   common rooms are each approximately 16' x 12'.  Each suite also has its own bathroom, which means no trekking down the hall in the middle of the night when you need to use the bathroom. Be advised that the bathrooms have no cabinetry so buying a plastic storage container is advisable, especially for those of you who have lots of toiletry items.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>In the common room you will find a bookcase (pictured below), tiled flooring, and space to be adventurous. Wiessmen often choose to outfit their common rooms with couches, recliners, mini-fridges, etc., but if you are apprehensive about transporting large furniture, rest assured that there almost always tend to be cheap furniture floating around with “a lot of sentimental value.” If that doesn't work out there are also great (read: economical) furniture places in Houston, and you can always try your luck with Craigslist. Most common rooms can very comfortably fit a large couch or two small couches, your mini-fridge and a TV stand (to give you a better idea about size).</p>
                        <p>If you're planning to share appliances or entertainment devices (e.g. TV, DVD player) with your roommate and suitemates, make sure to communicate with them in advance. You probably don't want to end up with three mini-fridges and no microwave (or do you?).</p>

Most people don't find it necessary to bunk their beds, and there's not much of a need for more furniture in you bedroom, unless you want to have a special desk chair or a simple bookshelf.</p>
