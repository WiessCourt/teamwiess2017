                <h4>We here at Wiess are all so excited to meet you, and you will be receiving a humongous book of information about Wiess shortly. If you're feeling impatient, here's some information about the college where you will spend an amazing four years. First, we have a number of useful and unique spaces available to students.  The space below are open to students at any time, however if you want to ensure a room's availability during a certain time, you can reserve a room with your Wiess secretary Meagan Dwyer using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/rice.edu/forms/d/1uBG7GAUopbA3lRZD-6x9JQkcKuNBi_oxxdyoZZVk0JQ/viewform">this form.</a></h4>

                        <p>
                            Wiess is home to the largest commons on campus, which means lots of space and shockingly effective sound muffling. During the day, enjoy our huge windows while eating lunch with fellow Wiessmen, or find a quiet table to study on late at night. It also has a piano which is frequented by our resident musicians. Most big events at Wiess, such as NOD, Salsa Night, and even our Superbowl watching party, are held in the Commons.

                            The movie room is seriously the stuff of legend and the desire of every other college on campus. We have brand new, extremely comfortable couches, stadium seating, and a recently installed projector with 4k picture capabilities (people who understand technology claim this is very impressive). This is a great place to spend a Friday night with some friends and lots of popcorn, but be sure to check the Wiess calendar online to see if it's already been reserved! Also check out the huge Wiess movie collection, housed by our Movie Reps. It's located on the fourth floor by the elevator.

                            When you inevitably find yourself running out of clothes and clean socks, fear not. Wiess has its very own laundry room, and the machines are free! Just remember to follow the rules: if someone's wet clothes are in the washing machine you need, move them to the dryer <b>on low or medium heat</b>, and if clothes in a dryer are still wet, run them again! Don't forget to bring High Efficiency detergent: good for your clothes and the environment. The laundry room is located on the first floor right by the Commons.

                            This quiet room attached to the Commons is a nice place to have meetings and is frequented by the A-Team and the Rice Philharmonics. There's a lot of Wiess history in here, including pictures of all our former Masters, and a lot of old Campanile's as well. Look for pictures of Dr. Byrd as a student, or camp out to get down to business.

                            Sparky's used to be a Wiess storage closet, but has been slowly transformed in the past five years in various different directions. This vibrant goldenrod room is a great place to study during the day, play various games with your friends, or even watch some powderpuff. We have lots of tables, mini basketball hoops, big windows, and of course, the Wiess crest. Sparky’s is located on the fourth floor right next to the movie room and tucked away in the corner.

We just recently completely redesigned it, with new counters, new tile and new stoves! Ask the Kitchen Reps for access to any baking supplies you need.

                        <h3>Your Suite</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>For your first year, you will be assigned to what we call a double—a suite with four people in two rooms and a shared common room. The bedrooms and   common rooms are each approximately 16' x 12'.  Each suite also has its own bathroom, which means no trekking down the hall in the middle of the night when you need to use the bathroom. Be advised that the bathrooms have no cabinetry so buying a plastic storage container is advisable, especially for those of you who have lots of toiletry items.</p>

                        <h3>Your Common Room</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>In the common room you will find a bookcase (pictured below), tiled flooring, and space to be adventurous. Wiessmen often choose to outfit their common rooms with couches, recliners, mini-fridges, etc., but if you are apprehensive about transporting large furniture, rest assured that there almost always tend to be cheap furniture floating around with “a lot of sentimental value.” If that doesn't work out there are also great (read: economical) furniture places in Houston, and you can always try your luck with Craigslist. Most common rooms can very comfortably fit a large couch or two small couches, your mini-fridge and a TV stand (to give you a better idea about size).</p>
                        <p>If you're planning to share appliances or entertainment devices (e.g. TV, DVD player) with your roommate and suitemates, make sure to communicate with them in advance. You probably don't want to end up with three mini-fridges and no microwave (or do you?).</p>

                        <p>The standard bedroom furniture for each student is a three-drawer dresser, a wardrobe closet (pictured to the right), a desk, a desk chair and a <b>twin EXTRA LONG</b> (make sure you get the right size sheets!) bed that is bunkable and can be lofted to different heights. Most people don't find it necessary to bunk their beds, and there's not much of a need for more furniture in you bedroom, unless you want to have a special desk chair or a simple bookshelf.</p>

                      <p>Welcome to Team Family Wiess from the Schaefer Family! Although this is the Schaefers’ first year as Masters of Wiess, they have a long history with the college. Andrew is Wiess ‘94 (CAAM and Math Econ) and Laura is Wiess ‘95 (MECH and English), and they met as undergrads at (Old) Wiess in 1991. They started dating two years later, when Laura built a (still-extant) exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum and Andrew had a summer job doing math for the CIA (shhh!) in Washington, DC. They went off to graduate school at Georgia Tech in 1995, where they received their PhDs, and were professors at the University of Pittsburgh from 2000-2015. (During that time, the Schaefer family spent a magical year on sabbatical in London, where they lived in a small, fifth-floor flat in the middle of everything.)</p>
                      <p>Andrew is a professor in the Department of Computational and Applied Math. His research is in optimization, in particular how to make decisions in treating diseases. Laura is a professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Her work is centered on improving the environmental impact of energy consumption, both through increasing energy efficiency and investigating alternative energy generation technologies. Andrew grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, and Laura lived in Illinois, Houston (well, the Woodlands), and Maryland. They love international travel, HBO series, foreign films, art, literature, hiking and all kinds of music.</p>
                      <p>There are two other important members of the Schaefer family: Elizabeth (nearly 13, and a self-proclaimed member of the Wiess class of 2026) and David (10). Elizabeth is a rising seventh grader at St. John’s School. She enjoys all of her subjects. She runs track, plays field hockey, and does junior classical league and quiz bowl (her team won the Texas state championship for her grade level last year). She has been interested in economics for many years. David is a rising fourth grader at Annunciation Orthodox School (obviously a Greek school, though we aren’t Greek). He is very adept at Legos and origami, and will happily challenge you to a game of chess. He is really into Greek mythology, and loves Percy Jackson. He likes camping, playing guitar, throwing Frisbees, and eating xiao long bao. Both are voracious readers who also love playing outside with their friends. The kids have been to over 40 countries – they love learning about various cultures, including food, history, and a few phrases.</p>
                      <p>The Schaefers are die-hard sports fans – Rice, of course, and an eclectic collection of professional teams: White Sox, Pirates, Packers, Steelers, Bulls, and Penguins. Andrew's grandfather played high school football for Curly Lambeau in Green Bay! They were a divided family during Super Bowl XLV between the Packers and Steelers.</p>
                      <p>The Schaefers are eager to welcome you to Wiess, and to the residential college system, which is part of what makes Rice the best undergraduate institution. The college system is both a small, intimate setting where you get to know a group of students extremely well, and also a framework for students to develop different cultures. The college system includes everyone, while maintaining eleven separate identities. The Schaefers feel that the Rice college system (and Wiess in particular) is "in their DNA" - it has shaped them (and continues to shape them) in many ways. As Masters, they are eager to help you in your journey through the undergraduate years - please share both your concerns and your triumphs with them, and join them for a chat about Rice, Houston, or your future path.</p>

                        <p>Renata is not known for making many mistakes, but once upon a time she was an Associate at a lesser college. She was quick to fix that lapse in judgment and dragged Lenin to join TFW. This will be their 5th year as RAs! Gavin (also known as the Acatoddler) and Evan (known as the Acababy) have been Wiessmen all of their lives: they were born across the street, but only took them 36 hours to find their way to Wiess. These four from the 3rd floor love to spend time around Wiess and Wiessmen, and their door is always open if you need to chat, relax or simply have somebody listen to you.</p>
                        <p>Besides being RAs at the best college, Renata teaches in the Bioengineering department, Lenin works for Schlumberger, Gavin loves to play in the Acabowl and Evan goes wherever everyone else goes since he cannot move on his own. They enjoy food and travel and can be found regularly cheering for your Battlesows on the powderpuff field. Lenin likes scuba diving and Renata likes horseback riding; so Lenin dials back his respect for horses to go riding and Renata chooses to forget the reasons why humans are not aquatic to go diving.  Gavin absolutely loves baseball, frisbee, balls and the trampoline and he can be spotted playing in the Acabowl most days (he’ll drag you to play if you let him). Evan is always eating or sleeping, but will most likely be running around by the time you graduate. Join them for dinner, a movie, Monday Night Football or barbacoa study break!</p>

                        <p>Emilie ("Emmie") is the 4th floor RA. She is a scientist (Materials Science) educated at Northwestern and Cambridge University. She is fascinated by understanding the world around her by shooting lasers and electrons at it, and also has wide-ranging interests and an always positive personality. Amongst her hobbies, she spends several days a month traveling, lots of it for work; she enjoys every moment of it. She also loves when people travel to see her, and several times a year she hosts her brother AJ or her partner John; both get involved with college life by co-organizing study breaks….talking of which, watch out for Emmie’s famous pancake study breaks, as well as liquid nitrogen ice cream shows!</p>
                        <p>Emmie is a seasoned runner, and has completed 6 marathons so far. She is eager to share her love of running and healthy living with Fellow Wiessmen. Look for her weekly running schedule in your email inbox, and come join her for a moderately-paced 3 to 6 miles run around campus! She also loves speaking her native French, going to the symphony, and studying alongside Wiessmen.</p>

                        <p>Ewart (pronounced eee-wert or you-were depending on if you are from Scotland) wears many hats at Wiess, a few of them have something to do with his actual job as College Coordinator. Officially, he assists Dr. Byrd with the administration at Wiess. Unofficially, he is the mail guru (he has been known to offer remedial course in envelope addressing), fax master (Why are people still using fax machines?), daytime RA (someone has to do it), holder of the keys (losing your keys gets you gentle mocking and a head shake), assistant to the Wiess treasurers (reluctantly), career counselor (we all need jobs) and human almanac (if he does not know the answer to your question, he will try to find it OR direct you to the Google machine on the inter web).</p>
                        <p>He can be found Monday through Friday in the Wiess office and if you don't mind sass, you are free to come by and chat him up, but bring your A-game. Bottom line: Ewart exists in his current form to make your life at Wiess function as smoothly as possible.</p>
                        <p>From time to time you will see two smaller, female versions of Ewart running around. Don't be alarmed, those are his daughters, Vivian and Tabitha. Vivian will talk to you, Tabitha won't. They are super cute and somewhat entertaining. If you like bow ties, cycling, photography and the Dallas Cowboys, you and Ewart will get along just fine (and even if you don't like those things…).</p>
